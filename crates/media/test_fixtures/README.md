These synthetic 256×192 H.264 High-profile MP4 fixtures were created for Fanta's native poster decoder tests. They contain one second at four frames per second. The first half has red/green/blue/yellow quadrants; the second half inverts their colors, making the first-frame check distinguish a different timestamp. There is no audio or external media reference. The encoded samples explicitly use limited-range BT.709 with matching matrix, primaries, and transfer tags.

The 90°, 180°, 270°, and mirrored files contain the same encoded samples with only the standard `tkhd` transform matrix changed. Their orientation and quadrant pixels were independently checked with ffprobe/ffmpeg. The corrupt fixture retains the original MP4 metadata but replaces the `mdat` payload with zeroes, so it must fail actual decoding.

`quadrants-tiny.mp4` is a separate 64×48 no-upscaling control encoded with `8x8dct=0`. On the validation Mac, AVFoundation and ffmpeg disagreed on the tiny clip's decoded chroma when 8×8 transforms were enabled; disabling only that encoder option corrected the native pixels. The larger High-profile fixture retains 8×8 transforms. Untagged samples also exercised a native fallback color profile, so explicit BT.709 tags avoid ambiguous color expectations. Test color tolerance is unchanged; these fixtures do not establish correctness for every platform/codec combination.

The primary fixture was generated with ffmpeg/libx264:

```sh
ffmpeg -f lavfi -i color=black:s=256x192:r=4:d=1 \
  -vf "drawbox=x=0:y=0:w=128:h=96:color=red:t=fill,drawbox=x=128:y=0:w=128:h=96:color=lime:t=fill,drawbox=x=0:y=96:w=128:h=96:color=blue:t=fill,drawbox=x=128:y=96:w=128:h=96:color=yellow:t=fill,scale=in_color_matrix=bt601:out_color_matrix=bt709,negate=enable='gte(t,0.5)'" \
  -c:v libx264 -crf 12 -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart \
  -color_range tv -colorspace bt709 -color_primaries bt709 -color_trc bt709 quadrants.mp4
```

For the tiny control, dimensions and quadrant boundaries are divided by four, and `-x264-params 8x8dct=0` is added. The variants' transform matrices apply the corresponding quarter turn or horizontal reflection with positive display-space translation.

All fixture artwork and generated clips are original synthetic test data, released under the repository's Apache-2.0 license. Runtime tests use the platform decoder; ffmpeg is not a dependency of the app or its tests.

`playback-three-scenes.mp4` is a three-second, 30 fps, 256×192 High-profile clip with the same BT.709 encoding settings. Its first second contains the quadrants, the second is cyan and the third is magenta. It has no audio. Native player tests use these distinct frames to verify time advancement, pause, accurate seeking, latest-request coalescing and restart after the end. The dedicated `video_playback` Cargo test target runs on its main thread and pumps the public Core Foundation run loop because AVPlayer readiness requires the main queue; ordinary worker-thread libtest is retained for poster and pure geometry tests.

The corrupt fixture must fail an actual first-source-frame decode during preparation. On the validation Mac, AVPlayer's video compositor substituted a black frame and reported a normal end for these zeroed samples, so ready/end status alone did not validate media. The preparation check uses the same asset and temporary input at a 64-pixel bound; it does not validate every later sample or replace real-time player output.
